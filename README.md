<a href="http://www.POWER-KI.com">POWER-KI official site </a> 

POWER-KI establishes a New and Original paradigm for programming languages. 

Among the most significant features:
- separation between Data, Flow, Code;
- Full Reflective;
- Native Cloud:
- simple code syntax;
- Core library (DataBase, Knowledge Base, OPC-UA ..);
- Wrap technology to extend with external or custom libraries.

The WorkBench, included in the DEV distribution, is the development environment for editing:
- of the code;
- GUI Ggraphic User Interface;
- WUI Web User Interface (HTML5, CSS);
as well as testing and debugging.
 
The ecosystem of applications ranges from Wiz and Tools, for the automation of application generation and hot debugging (PWK-Insider), to applications such as PWK-ES Enterprise Server for the management of applications and Cloud services.

<h3>INSTALL-PACKAGE:</h3>
