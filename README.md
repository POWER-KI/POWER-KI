POWER-KI&reg; the programming language for Intelligent Applications (IA)</br>

POWER-KI establishes a New and Original paradigm for programming languages. 

Among the most significant features:
- Program Code as a Knowledge Base with separation between Data, Flow, Code;
- Plastic Architecture (Full-Reflective, Self-Modifiable and Persitence of executing elements);
- Designed for Multi Threading;
- Native Cloud:
- Simple Code Syntax for easy behaviour understanding;
- Core Library (DataBase, Knowledge Base, OPC-UA ..);
- Wrap technology to extend with external or custom libraries (OpenCV, RealSense2, Snap7, Voice ...).


The WorkBench, included in the DEV distribution, is the development environment for editing:
- of the code;
- GUI Graphic User Interface;
- WUI Web User Interface (HTML5, CSS);

as well as for testing, debugging and deploy.
 
The ecosystem of applications ranges from Wiz and Tools for the automation of application generation and hot debugging (PWK-Insider), to applications such as PWK-ES Enterprise Server for the management of applications and Cloud services.

POWER-KI is an industrial grade language, which has found wide use in advanced factory and plant automation applications, what now is called Factory 4.0, anticipating its times by a decade. 
But the application possibilities range from the Web/eCommerce, to the IoT, to decision-making and management systems in general.</br>
